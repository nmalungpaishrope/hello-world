My name is Noppadol Malungpaishrope. I do have a nickname that I go by which is Troy. I am an international student from Thailand who is currently studying Business Analytics and Information Systems as well as pursuing a Computer Science minor at the University of Iowa.

# Why I came to Iowa
Truthfully, I barely applied to any schools in the United States. However, the two schools I did apply to were the University of Iowa and the University of Michigan. I had a good high school resume and decent SAT and AP scores so I got into both. However, I decided to come to Iowa because the financial aid was significantly better than in Michigan.
