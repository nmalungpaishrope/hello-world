My name is Noppadol Malungpaishrope. I do have a nickname that I go by which is Troy. I am an international student from Thailand who is currently studying Business Analytics and Information Systems as well as pursuing a Computer Science minor at the University of Iowa.

# Why Did I Come to Iowa?
*Truthfully, I barely applied to any schools in the United States. However, the two schools I did apply to were the University of Iowa and the University of Michigan. I had a good high school resume and decent SAT and AP scores so I got into both. However, I decided to come to Iowa because the financial aid was significantly better than in Michigan.*

## What Were Some Major Differences between the United States and Thailand?
**There are many differences that I've experienced since moving here from Thailand. Some good, some bad, most are subjective and somewhere in between. I've had my fair share of cold weather before, but that was only in smaller circumstances when we went on trips abroad to colder countries. However, since moving to Iowa, I've had to learn to live in cold temperatures as the norm for months on end. The food here is also quite different. It is more of a personal preference thing, but I would be lying if I said I didn't miss the food that my mom would make back home in Thailand**
